# 2. Design Database Schema (DDL)

## 📌 Objective
Write **SQL queries** to define the **database schema** (create tables, set constraints).

---

## 📝 Instructions
- Based on the **provided database specification**, create **`CREATE TABLE`** statements for each entity.  
- Ensure:
  - Proper **data types**  
  - **Primary keys**  
  - **Foreign keys**  
  - **Constraints** (e.g., `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`)  
- Create **necessary indexes** on columns for optimal performance.  

---

## 📂 Repo Structure
- **GitHub repository:** `alx-airbnb-database`  
- **Directory:** `database-script-0x01`  
- **Files:**  
  - `schema.sql` → contains all SQL DDL queries for schema creation.  
  - `README.md` → documents schema design, tables, and relationships.  

---

## ✅ Deliverables
- A **fully functional database schema** that reflects the **Airbnb-like application**.  
- Clean, well-structured **SQL scripts** with comments.  
- Documentation (`README.md`) explaining:
  - Tables and their purpose  
  - Relationships between entities  
  - Indexing decisions  

---

✨ Once complete, this schema will serve as the **foundation** for seeding the database with sample data in later tasks.
