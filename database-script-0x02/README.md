# 3. Seed the Database with Sample Data

## 📌 Objective
Create **SQL scripts** to populate the database with **realistic sample data**.

---

## 📝 Instructions
- Write **`INSERT` statements** to add sample data for key entities:  
  - **User**  
  - **Property**  
  - **Booking**  
  - **Payment**  
- Ensure the data reflects **real-world usage**, including:  
  - Multiple users with varied profiles  
  - Properties of different types and locations  
  - Bookings linked to valid users and properties  
  - Payments tied to bookings  

---

## 📂 Repo Structure
- **GitHub repository:** `alx-airbnb-database`  
- **Directory:** `database-script-0x02`  
- **Files:**  
  - `seed.sql` → contains all SQL `INSERT` statements for populating tables.  
  - `README.md` → documents seeding strategy and sample data overview.  

---

## ✅ Deliverables
- A **`seed.sql`** file with clean and well-structured **SQL insert statements**.  
- **Sample data** that demonstrates realistic application behavior.  
- A **README.md** explaining:  
  - Data distribution across entities  
  - Relationships maintained during seeding  
  - Assumptions made for realistic simulation  

---

✨ This dataset will be used to **test queries** and simulate a **production-like environment** for the Airbnb database project.
